# RayTracing
A Computer Graphics project
 
This is a Computer Graphics project for the summer of 2020 in order to improve my programming skills in C++ and .
 
For the project I'm visiting the next pages:

* [Scratchapixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/) - Page with a lot of information about the maths behind the Ray Tracer.
* [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) - Book that explains how to make a RayTracing in a shorter and fun way. It does not profundice in the maths.
